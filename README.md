# Express API Starter with Typescript

Original template found here: https://github.com/w3cj/express-api-starter.git. I've heavily modified it so that you can have an excellent development experience.

## How to use this template

1. You need `bun` package manager installed on your system https://bun.sh/.
2. Some of the scripts make use of Node Version Manager (`nvm`) https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm. If you don't want to install it, just search for `nvm` in this repo and adjust.

## Utilities
